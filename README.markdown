GeoptMathLib
============

This is a Java library for vector algebra extracted from a ray tracer *Geopt*, which was my second year's coursework in the university. It contains things basic rayracer would need in its foundation: "semi-mutable" `Vector` class (i.e. there are methods to mutate it, but only for performance optimizations), and primitive shapes like `Plane` and `Sphere`.

The repo was imported from the SVN repo with entire Geopt, so some commit messages are irrelevant to changes in the MathLib. And, they're in Russian. Historic material! ^_^
